# PROJECT_STATE — circuit-next

**Phase:** 2 — Implementation (continuing). See
[PROJECT_STATE-chronicle.md](PROJECT_STATE-chronicle.md) for the
relocated narrative log + the full phase block with CC#14 retarget
context and phase-open provenance.

Chronicle (relocated narrative history — non-authoritative; see
disclaimer at file top) at
[PROJECT_STATE-chronicle.md](PROJECT_STATE-chronicle.md).

*This file carries only live state. Per-slice narrative — historical
reference, with authoritative ceremony evidence in the commit bodies
themselves — is relocated to the chronicle and appended by each slice
ceremony. Live state at `## §0` above is the machine-readable surface
for new consumers (`readLiveStateSection` helper in `scripts/audit.mjs`);
the `<!-- current_slice: N -->` HTML-comment marker at file top is
preserved unchanged for existing consumers (doctor.mjs, inventory.mjs,
audit.mjs status-epoch + freshness + arc-close gate + contract tests) per
ADR-0010 compat-shim discipline. Slice 68 ARC-CLOSE fold-in (Codex MED-2):
authority wording reconciled with chronicle's own "non-authoritative
history" disclaimer — commits are authoritative, chronicle is narrative
companion. Runtime Safety Floor plan revision 03 reached challenger-cleared
on 2026-04-24 via `specs/reviews/runtime-safety-floor-codex-challenger-03.md`
and received operator signoff on 2026-04-24; implementation slices have not
opened yet.*
