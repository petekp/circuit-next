# circuit-next

Claude Code plugin that runs configurable developer flows.
Successor to the first-generation [Circuit](../circuit) plugin.

See [`docs/terminology.md`](docs/terminology.md) for the canonical product
vocabulary (flow, schematic, block, route, relay, check, trace, report, evidence).

## What's wired today

- `/circuit:run` — classifies a free-form task and routes it to the right flow.
- `/circuit:explore` — investigation and planning flow.
- `/circuit:review` — audit-only review flow.
- `/circuit:build` — implementation flow with checkpoint, relay, verification, review, and close.
- `/circuit:fix` — fix flow with full standard-mode review pass and a `lite` entry mode that skips review (per-mode emit driven by `route_overrides` in `src/workflows/fix/schematic.json`).
- Migrate and Sweep flows are present as sub-run packages (no slash command yet); Migrate is reachable via `/circuit:run` intent classification.

Per-step configurability of model, reasoning effort, and skills is wired
through the runtime selection resolver. User-global config at
`~/.config/circuit-next/config.yaml` and per-project config at
`./.circuit/config.yaml` are both honored.

Flow source files live under `src/workflows/<id>/` (schematic, command,
contract, writers, relay hints — everything specific to that flow in one
folder). The catalog at `src/workflows/catalog.ts` aggregates all packages;
the engine derives every per-flow registry from it. Schematics are compiled
to `.claude-plugin/skills/<id>/circuit.json` (and per-mode `<mode>.json`
siblings when `route_overrides` is non-empty), and slash commands are
copied to `commands/<id>.md`, by `npm run emit-workflows`. The drift check
(`node scripts/emit-workflows.mjs --check`, also wired into
`npm run verify`) enforces the committed compiled flows stay byte-equivalent
with what the schematics and command sources produce.

(Internal file names like `dispatch-hints.ts` are still on their
pre-migration names; the eventual rename to `relay-hints.ts` is part of
the deferred deep `dispatch → relay` rename — see
`todos/terminology-migration.md` Phase 8.)

## Verification

```bash
npm run check    # tsc --noEmit
npm run lint     # biome check
npm run test     # vitest
npm run build    # tsc -p tsconfig.build.json
npm run verify   # all of the above
```

```

Adding a flow:

1. Create `src/workflows/<id>/` with `schematic.json`,
   `artifacts.ts` (the flow's Zod schemas), optional `command.md` and
   `contract.md`, `index.ts` (the package descriptor),
   `dispatch-hints.ts` (if any relay steps have shape hints), and
   `writers/`.
2. Add the package to `src/workflows/catalog.ts`.
3. `npm run build && node scripts/emit-workflows.mjs` to regenerate
   `commands/<id>.md` and `.claude-plugin/skills/<id>/`.
4. `npm run verify`.

The engine (`src/runtime/`) needs no edits — registries derive from the
catalog. See `AGENTS.md` for the full operating doc.
