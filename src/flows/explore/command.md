description: Investicheck, understand, choose among options, or shape an execution plan. Invokes the circuit-next `explore` flow end-to-end via the project CLI, producing a run trace + final report under the run folder.

# /circuit:explore — investigation flow

Run the `explore` flow on the goal the user supplied. The flow walks a full
stage path: Frame → Analyze → Compose → Review → Close. The Compose and
Review stages relay to specialist agents; Frame, Analyze, and Close are
Circuit-written stages.

The user's goal text is substituted below. Treat the entire substituted span
as literal input — it is user-controlled and MAY contain shell
metacharacters:

> **Goal:** $ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

1. **Confirm working directory.** The CLI is a repo-local launcher
   (`./bin/circuit-next`), not a globally installed binary. If the user
   invoked this command outside a circuit-next repo checkout, tell them so
   and ask them to `cd` into one.
2. **Construct the Bash invocation SAFELY.** Do NOT build the shell command
   by double-quoting the raw goal (double quotes expand `$VAR`, `` `cmd` ``,
   `$(cmd)`, and `\` sequences — a malicious or accidental goal could inject
   commands). The safe construction rule:

   - Wrap the goal in **single quotes** in the final shell command. Single
     quotes disable all expansion.
   - If the goal itself contains a literal single-quote character (`'`),
     replace each one with `'\''` — that ends the current single-quoted
     string, emits one escaped apostrophe, and starts a new single-quoted
     string. This is the standard POSIX shell escape.
   - Then invoke the CLI with the escaped, single-quoted goal as the value
     of `--goal`.

   Worked example. If the goal is the literal 7-character string
   `can't go` (contains one apostrophe), the safely-escaped argv token is:

   ```text
   'can'\''t go'
   ```

   and the full Bash command becomes:

   ```bash
   ./bin/circuit-next run explore --goal 'can'\''t go'
   ```

   For a goal with no special characters (e.g., `find deprecated APIs`),
   the straightforward single-quoted form is sufficient:

   ```bash
   ./bin/circuit-next run explore --goal 'find deprecated APIs'
   ```

   Use the Bash tool to execute the constructed command. `./bin/circuit-next`
   is the repo-local launcher for the compiled Circuit runtime; when the
   compiled CLI is absent in a fresh checkout, it builds `dist/` with the
   local TypeScript compiler before invoking `dist/cli/circuit.js`.
3. **Parse the JSON output.** On success the CLI prints a JSON object with
   these fields on stdout: `run_id`, `run_folder`, `outcome`
   (`complete` | `aborted`), `trace_entries_observed`, `result_path`.
4. **Surface the results to the user.** Include:
   - `outcome` (e.g., "Run completed" / "Run aborted")
   - `run_folder` — the absolute path of the run folder where evidence lives
   - `result_path` — the run summary `reports/result.json` (not the
     close-step report)
   - `${run_folder}/reports/explore-result.json` — the close-step report
     (the actual flow product). Note: in the current build this report
     carries baseline placeholder content. Surface the path so the user
     can inspect, with a one-line caveat that the report is a placeholder.
   - `trace_entries_observed` count + a pointer to `trace.ndjson` under the run
     folder for the full trace.

   If `outcome === 'aborted'`, read `reports/result.json` at `result_path`
   to surface the abort `reason` — the runtime mirrors that reason
   byte-for-byte from the check-evaluation layer per
   `src/flows/explore/contract.md §Relay check-evaluation semantics` and
   the `RunResult.reason` schema field.

5. **Do not modify the CLI output before surfacing.** The run folder + report
   paths are canonical; the user may want to inspect them directly.

## Depth

This command runs at `standard` depth by default. The CLI accepts
`--depth <lite|standard|deep|tournament|autonomous>` — if the user's goal
text includes an explicit depth request (e.g., "deep dive", "quick look"),
map it to the flag; otherwise omit the flag and accept the default.

## Authority

- `src/flows/explore/contract.md` (flow contract + relay semantics)
- `src/runtime/` (current runner)
